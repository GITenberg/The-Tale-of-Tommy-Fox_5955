description: For a long time Tommy waited there. He kept very still. And he stayed
  hidden behind the tree, with only one eye peeping round the tree- trunk, so that
  he could watch for Mr. Woodchuck. He was very patient-- was Tommy. You have to be
  patient, you know, when you are hunting. He crouched behind the tree for at least
  an hour, and never once took his eye off that hole. And at last he saw Mr. Woodchuck's
  nose come popping out.
